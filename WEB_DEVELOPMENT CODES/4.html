            You may write me down in history
            With your bitter, twisted lies,
            You may tread me in the very dirt
            But still, like dust, <strong>I'll rise</strong>.
        </pre>
        <pre style ="color : rgb(0, 21, 255)">
            Does my sassiness upset you?
            Why are you beset with gloom?
            'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
            Pumping in my living room.
        </pre>
        <pre style ="color : rgb(0, 255, 0)">
            Just like moons and like suns,
            With the certainty of tides,
            Just like hopes springing high,
            Still <strong>I'll rise</strong>.
        </pre>
        <pre style ="color : rgb(0, 213, 255)">
            Did you want to see me broken?
            Bowed head and lowered eyes?
            Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
            Weakened by my soulful cries.
        </pre>
        <pre style ="color : rgb(255, 0, 200)">
            Does my haughtiness offend you?
            Don't you take it awful hard
            'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
            Diggin' in my own back yard.
        </pre>
        <pre style ="color : rgb(255, 153, 0)">
            You may shoot me with your words,
            You may cut me with your eyes,
            You may kill me with your hatefulness,
            But still, like air, <strong>I'll rise</strong>.
        </pre>
        <pre style ="color : rgb(0, 255, 170)">
            Does my sexiness upset you?
            Does it come as a surprise
            That I dance like I've got diamonds
            At the meeting of my thighs?
        </pre>
        <pre style ="color : rgb(255, 0, 119)">
            Out of the huts of history's shame
            <strong>I rise</strong>
            Up from a past that's rooted in pain
            <strong>I rise</strong>
            
            I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
            Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
            Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
            <strong>I rise</strong>
            Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
            <strong>I rise</strong>
            Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
            I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
            <strong>I rise</strong>
            <strong>I rise</strong>
            <strong>I rise</strong>
